### WTF IS STOMP

Stomp is a fully onchain game heavily inspired by monster battlers like Pokemon, the crossover energy of Smash Bros, the chaos of MUGEN, and the nostalgia of old RPGs. It's turn-based and 1v1. You build a team of mons, and you battle against other people in real time.

I want Stomp to be an exciting technical milestone in the legacy of interesting EVM applications. This is ambitious, to say the least, especially given the landscape.

We have collectively as an industry tried to make web3 gaming a "thing" for the past 3 cycles. Teams have raised $XXX million collectively to fund various games and/or studios, and almost all of them have shut down:

So why am I doing something so stupid as to try again?

Well, I think that many of these failures point to a mismatch between success for games and success for VCs. For an indie game, success can be anywhere from making $10k to $10m. How do you raise for something like that? Take $25k at a $500k valuation? Who is going to write that check? Historically crypto has had a massive liquidity premium, and last cycle's gaming entrants often had a large starting warchest in the millions thanks to NFT sales.

This is literally setting you up for failure. You have now screened off all the moderately positive outcomes that the normal market could have welcomed by setting the starting valuation expectation too high.

What, then, do these companies do to justify these valuations, either to the market or to investors? They either: a) pivot to becoming a game studio, aiming to use a "portfolio" of games under their banner to demonstrate a large combined playerbase, or b) start issuing digital assets way before the assets can do anything productive.

Both of these are terrible choices. If you try to make multiple games before you even polish your first turd, you just end up with lots of half-baked shit. Everything is going to be low-quality, you're deluding yourself if you think people will actually try all of your games. If you try to issue assets first, speculators will hype it up, especially if you are trying to maintain whatever expectations have already been foisted on you, and then there is basically NO GAME you can create that can justify an 8+ figure market cap. 

Either way, you're fucked.

And all of this is to speak nothing of the general base rates (most indie games fail) and the clientle (gamers are notoriously the second most entitled user group after airdrop farmers).

So you're doubly fucked.

Okay so again. WHY AM I DOING THIS???

Well, hopefully I've established above that you have to be kinda crazy to want to continue trying to make this work, and you need to either be especially frgual or self-funded.

Hi, my name is Owen, and I'm an underwater ETH bagholder. (Everyone, please say hi back.)

I think the EVM is an incredibly rich programming environment, and I want to broaden everyone's horizons. DeFi has seen incredible adoption and resilience, and we're now seeing broader market structure like prediction markets or futarchy. There is definitely so much more out there to build, so many other apps. I want to build something weird, something meaty, and something fun to bring onchain friends together. 

I am very delusional, but I suffer little about how much reach Stomp can realistically grow. This is a niche within a niche within a niche. And I am happy if the best it does is spawn little side events at every ETH conference (if, pray tell, there will even be more conferences in the future). We need a game that everyone can play, or understand, or bet on, or at least know a little bit about. 

We haven't had such a unifying cultural force since the last time everyone went apeshit over little black pieces of paper with divine robes written on the chain (you had to be there).

This is obviously not going to be anything close to esports or a normal gaming phenomenon. And that's okay, I want to celebrate the little cultural wins that we have had across crypto. In a time where people keep looking to RWAs and finding ways to bring cool IP back onto the chain, I remain wistfully hopeful for the weirdness that was web3-native IPs. 

Come try the game out if you get a chance, we got your bullas, beras, miladies, hypurrs, llamas, and more coming in the roster.

Along the way, I hope that some of the ideas built around the game engine can find root in other projects. For the nerds, come check out the codebase! We've got a super fucked up solidity to typescript transpiler for full js emulation and a super fast one-step commit-reveal flow for handling matchmaking and turns. Onchain maximalism where it matters.

So here's the tldr of what I'm thinking with Stomp: Onchain markets are the most powerful and expressive tools we have for exchanging value, so they seem like a perfect fit for games that use the same substrate. But if that's ALL your game has, then it too quickly devolves into a mere money game (see: every single gamefi project with a down-only inflationary token). You cannot play-to-earn, win-to-earn, risk-to-earn, shit-to-earn, eat-to-earn, etc for a game. That is simply called having a job.

Games are labors of love and expression and emotion. We literally have a phrase for doing something for the love of it. 

But, BUT. If the game is good, if the base layer is interesting enough that people care about the characters, the progression, the outcome, then we have something interesting. You can let loose all the experimentation we've seen with bonding curves, order books, hyperps, whatever. Then, you have real stakes and real value.

Sadly, I am not early to these ideas. You are not early. Nobody reading this is early. Stomp is a project that has come two cycles too late. But now, we actually have good enough tooling and fast enough chains. It's the elventh hour, and good news is the cavalry is coming. 

> "But Doctor, I AM the cavalry!"

In our crypto "friendly" regime, sentiment and prices are basically at an ATL. Thought work itself is getting automated away, and everyone is gone. There's about four of us Japanese soldiers left in this jungle, and we've been running ourselves ragged. 

Why not take a little break?
